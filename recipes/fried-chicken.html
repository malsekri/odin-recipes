    <h1>Recipe for fried chicken</h1>
    <img src = "../images/fried-chicken.jpg">
    <p>I love fried chicken. Everytime a piece of succulent chicken graces my tastebuds with its presence I get joyful. For that reason, I decided to share the first recipe I found online of fried chicken on this test website. </p>
    <p>Truth be told, this recipe needs to add more seasonings and it probably won't be the best thing you'll have ever tasted. Regardless, it will still taste good with a condiment of your choice just as all fried chicken does. Enjoy the recipe below!</p>
