    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
<li>4 ounces cream cheese, softened</li>

<li>4 teaspoons dried dill weed, divided</li>

<li>4 tablespoons minced garlic, divided</li>

<li>2 skinless, boneless chicken breast halves</li>

<li>2 tablespoons butter, softened</li>

<li>1 small tomato, sliced</li>

<li>2 leaves lettuce</li>

<li>4 thick slices French bread</li>

    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
<ol>

<li>Mix cream cheese, 2 teaspoons dill, and 2 tablespoons garlic together in a medium bowl; set aside.</li>
<li>Season chicken with remaining garlic and dill.</li>
<li>Melt 1 tablespoon butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add chicken and cook until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 8 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove from the pan.</li>
<li>Butter one side of each slice of bread with remaining butter. Toast buttered bread in the skillet until golden, about 2 minutes.</li>
<li>Remove bread from the skillet. Spread 1/2 of the cream cheese mixture onto the unbuttered sides of 2 bread slices. Top each slice with lettuce, tomato slices, chicken breast, and remaining bread.</li>
</ol>
